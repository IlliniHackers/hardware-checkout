## Policies
We're proud to have an assortment of hardware for you to check out for projects. We offer three types of checkout:
 1. For Use During Hack Nights
 2. For Use in a Project Over a Period of Up to 3 Months
 3. For ACM Sigs or IEEE TAGs
 
Please note that we will require all hardware back for HackIllinois when that occurs. Additionally, you may be responsible for the price of the hardware if you break it.

Policies are subject to change. Organizers may make changes at will, and all decisions are final. Just use common sense, and we won't have any problems.
### For Use During Hack Nights
At a hack night, you'll be able to check out anything we have for the duration of the night. In exchange, we'll record your name in this repository and hold your government ID as collateral. We'll also need your name, netid, and phone number. At the end of the event (or when you leave), you can exchange the hardware for your ID. 
 
### For 3 Months
Since we have less control over this, we'll need to collect a deposit. As of now, we've opted to collect a deposit for up to 85% of the purchase price of the hardware (this is subject to change). We will accept this through Venmo or Google Wallet (details TBA). Your details will be recorded in this repository. When you return the hardware by the due date, you will receive your deposit back if the hardware still works. If you do not return the hardware in time, we will assess a late fee of $1 / day. Please keep this in mind. 

If the hardware is returned in time and in working condition, you will be refunded your money completely. If you don't return the hardware, we'll keep the deposit. Please don't keep the hardware.

### For ACM Sigs or IEEE TAGs
Please contact us directly. We will be able to setup longer duration or rentals without deposit. 


### Hardware Lab Contents
Here's what is in our hardware lab. This list is not kept up to date in terms of quantity. We'll try and acquire more throughout the year:
